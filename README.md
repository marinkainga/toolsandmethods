For this project, we conducted an analysis of the book "A lady's life in the Rocky Mountains" by Isabella Bird. In this novel, Isabella Bird writes about her travels through the Rocky Mountains, starting from Lake Tahoe in California and finishing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The novel is comprised of her letters that she wrote to her sister during her journey. Our research question was as follows: how does her sentiment change over time during her travels? We conducted a sentiment analysis of her book, where we analysed the polarity, subjectivity and sentiment. We visualized this in ArcGIS, and then added the ArcGIS map in StoryMaps. The StoryMap gives an interactive experience of the ArcGIS map. This repository consists a metadata csv file and a csv file for the sentiment analysis. It also includes a link to the storymaps.
